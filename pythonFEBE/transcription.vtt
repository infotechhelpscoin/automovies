1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,700
Apple Intelligence in 5 minutes.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
It's personal intelligence right where you need it, on your

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,140
Mac, iPad, and iPhone.

4
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:12,885
Writing tools are an example of the incredible power of

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:13,785
Apple Intelligence.

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,185
Say you're writing an email.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,120
You can change the tone to make it sound more

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,380
friendly, professional, or concise.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,940
Another way writing tools can help you is with Proofread.

10
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:30,665
With proofread, you can nail the grammar, word choice, and

11
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:31,565
sentence structure.

12
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:34,880
And if you've rambled on in your email, bring out

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,980
the key points and add them as a TLDR.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,965
Apple Intelligence is also great when it comes to images.

15
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,885
Let's jump in with Genmoji.

16
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:48,785
You want a T Rex on a surfboard? You've got

17
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:50,165
a T Rex on a surfboard.

18
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,510
Simply type a description of the emoji you want. How

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,690
about a smiley face with cucumber eyes or something random

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,085
like a squirrel DJ? And because Apple Intelligence knows who's

21
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,885
in your photo library, you can turn your friend V

22
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,025
into an astronaut.

23
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:07,985
Next up, Image Playground.

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,830
Create awesome images in seconds,

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,550
like an image of a cat as a chef.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,395
Just type rooftop and any other descriptive words, and it

27
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,815
generates the image in the middle playground area.

28
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:24,895
Then choose a style like animation,

29
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:26,255
sketch,

30
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,400
or illustration.

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,360
And it's done.

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,135
Apple Intelligence also understands who people are in your photo

33
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:37,635
library.

34
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:40,415
So you can create a personalized image of them for

35
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:41,155
their birthday.

36
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,315
Or your mom is a superhero.

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,970
Image 1 can transform your rough sketch into a polished

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,470
image.

39
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,770
You can use Apple Pencil to circle it, and Image

40
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,475
1 analyzes your sketch in words and creates an image

41
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,015
for you like magic.

42
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:01,655
Siri takes a huge step forward and is now supercharged

43
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:02,855
by Apple Intelligence.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,180
And when you talk to Siri, you'll notice this elegant

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,980
glowing light around the edge of your screen that shows

46
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,240
Apple Intelligence working for you.

47
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,855
With natural language, you can speak to Siri more naturally,

48
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:17,255
thanks to richer language understanding capabilities.

49
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:20,995
So if you stumble over words, Siri still understands what

50
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,940
you're getting at. What's the weather tomorrow morning at Muir

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,880
Beach? I mean, Muir Woods.

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,140
The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,240
near Muir Woods National Monument.

54
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:34,645
Siri also remembers what you've just been talking about.

55
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,265
Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9

56
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:37,765
AM.

57
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,630
Hike is scheduled for 9 AM to 11 AM on

58
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,450
June 11th.

59
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,970
Next, personal contact draws from your photos, calendar events, messages,

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,010
and other apps.

61
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,625
So let's say your mom is coming to visit.

62
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,545
Simply ask. Siri,

63
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:56,840
when is mom's flight landing? And Siri already knows who

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,800
mom is and will cross reference flight details from an

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,380
email to give you an up to date arrival time.

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,840
And if you've forgotten what plans you have, you can

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,975
say. What's our dinner plan? And Siri knows you mean

68
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,055
you and your mom and will find that information in

69
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,355
a text she sent you.

70
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:14,695
And if you don't wanna ask Siri out loud, you

71
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,560
can now type to Siri.

72
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,680
Just a double tap at the bottom of the screen,

73
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,735
and you can quickly and quietly type your Siri request.

74
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,615
Because Apple Intelligence is personal, priority notifications

75
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,620
show what's important to you by putting the most important

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,120
understands

77
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:33,496
who's

78
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:34,872
in

79
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,248
your

80
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:37,624
photo

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,085
library, so It understands who's in your photo library, so

82
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,565
you can just ask photos to create a movie about

83
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:45,865
Leo learning to fish.

84
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,670
And it'll whip up a film starring Leo,

85
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,470
water,

86
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,910
fishing rods,

87
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,790
and depending on how successful Leo was,

88
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,550
a fish.

89
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,435
So those are just a few of the ways Apple

90
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,535
Intelligence can help you every day.

91
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:03,520
It's super easy to use and gives you peace of

92
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,420
mind knowing it's designed with privacy from the ground up.

93
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,260
So that's Apple Intelligence,

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,740
AI for the rest of us.
